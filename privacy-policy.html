This Privacy Policy describes what information Iron Blanket collects when you use our products. By using our products, you consent to this policy. This policy may change from time to time, so please review it frequently. Your continued use of Iron Blanket’s products signifies your acceptance of changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>A. Information You Give Us Directly</h3>

    </ul>
    <p>When you participate in social features through a Social Media Site, the information you disclose is public information. We may store and access it, and it may be read, copied, collected, or used by other users without your consent. Please make sure your privacy settings on the Social Media Sites you use reflect your preferences.</p>
    <p>When you participate in online leaderboard components of our products, your in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics may be visible to all.</p>

    <h3>B. Other Information We Collect When You Use Our Products</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address.</li>
      <li>Mobile and other hardware or device identifiers or the advertising identifier.</li>
      <li>Browser information, including your browser type and the language you prefer.</li>
      <li>Referring and exit pages, including landing pages and pages viewed.</li>
      <li>Platform type.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>We may also collect and store information locally on your device, using mechanisms like cookies, browser web storage, and application data caches.</p>
    <p>To comply with local laws, we may need to collect your IP address to help us determine your country of residence. In that case, your IP address may be sent to a server that we control for evaluation purposes but will not be stored or further processed. We also use your device settings to determine the country where you are located as a way to respect privacy laws specific to your location. We do not collect your precise location, at a level more granular than your city, without your explicit consent.</p>

    <h3>C. Information Provided to Us by Third Parties</h3>
    <p>If you play or purchase our games or in-app purchases on your mobile device and/or tablet, we receive information about you from the app stores and other mobile platform providers. This information may include your username and/or device identification number and the fact that you made a purchase, for instance, but does not include any sensitive or financial information. Some of our mobile platforms also may send information to us that you authorize them to provide, through systems such as Google Play Services or Apple Game Center.</p>
    <p>We may receive information from third parties, like Facebook or other Social Media sites, when you use these services in connection with our products. We may also receive information about you when other players choose to share their contact lists with us. We also may receive information from third parties to supplement the information we receive from you. We use information from these companies primarily to help us deliver relevant advertising to you.</p>
    <p>We also may use information from third parties, for instance, to help us understand your approximate geolocation via your IP address for tax purposes, or to customize certain services to your location, and for fraud and/or abuse prevention purposes.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Collect Information</h2>
    <h3>A. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features, or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don’t see the same ad repeatedly, and otherwise enhance your user experience. We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie, such as web beacons, pixels, and other similar technologies. Your Internet web browser enables you to opt out of tracking with cookies. Please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> or the documentation for your individual web browser if you would like to learn more about managing your cookie preferences.</p>
    <p>We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our products, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud, and to enforce our Privacy Policy. Our legal basis for this collection and processing is to protect our legitimate business interests and therefore do not seek consent to collect your information for these purposes. You may contact <a href="mailto:bad.wolf.games36@gmail.com">bad.wolf.games36@gmail.com</a> if you have additional questions about these use cases.</p>

    <h3>B. Analytics Technologies</h3>
    <p>We use our own game servers and internal and third-party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our products, your computer or device, and the health of our products. For example, Iron Blanket may collect and store data from your device when you use our products. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, and system interactions. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and may be transmitted to Iron Blanket when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online components of our games, such as leaderboards, Iron Blanket may also collect, use, store, transmit, and publicly display statistical data regarding game scores and achievements. Third-party analytics services integrated into our products may combine the information they collect in connection with Iron Blanket’s services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites and applications. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h3>C. Ad Serving Technologies</h3>
    <p>Our products may employ ad-serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different mobile apps, devices, and websites. The ads can be tailored to your interests. This is called interest-based advertising.</p>
